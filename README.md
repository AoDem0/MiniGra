Vampires don't like light

this is my 3rd project in Unity (first one done by myself)

itch.io https://aodem0.itch.io/vampires-dont-like-light

important things i did in this project:
-player movement (without Time.deltaTime)
-camera following player
-player tracking area (if the player is not in the tracking area, the camera stops following the player)
-GameObject that follows to points
-hp
-parallax backgroud
-dialogue box
-music on loop
-SFX
